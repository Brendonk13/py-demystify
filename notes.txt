Todo:
    create global set of values
    figure out the diff shit and q's i wrote down

    new csv header:
        - the time a function was called in case we call the same fxn with same args each time
            -- ie
            for _ in [1,2]:
                fn()
            has 2 lines in the csv for this loop
            the new header is a number 1, 2 for each time it is called with the same signature

    I think I need to use the dis module to find intermediate fxn return values

convert to file writing:
    - then I can just print things and not have intermediate functions print in order of execution

    -- problem: how to make it clear for when the same function is called twice with diff arguments


Not working:

    not sure if I should be using a set anymore ..
    cuz i gotta convert hella other stuff to set each time

    Returns:
        a returned value doesnt print unless its a reassignment
            y = 5
            y = othh()
            works

            y = othh()
            -- prints nothing
