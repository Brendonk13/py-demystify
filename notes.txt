Major todos:
    - convert to using function objects
    - add support
    - fix smaller things
    - output to csv

Todo:
    - test execution_id across multiple function calls
    add callers execution_id so we know when a function_call is just a return !!

next: save this in git, see how it looks with printed on the same line and just fix formatting in general

NEXT: WORK ON THE ASSIGNED_CONSTANT PART TO USE THE FUNCTION INTERPRET_EXPRESSION
try to do a substitution for an if statement ?
or commit the work and start working on the one that generates a file
NEXT: when showing objects with changed fields, only record the field that changed, not both X and Y when only X is changed


Note: this thing kinda sucks at interpreting non-obvious things
*  119 │   y = [2]  #  y = [2]
*  121 │   y += ["a"]  #  y + = ["a"]
  y=[2] ──> new value: [2, 'a']

NEXT:
- try to delete 'vect': <__main__.Vector object at 0x7f40fd7df050>, and only store their fields
need to fix this for SELF


NEXT:
- MAKE STUPID MULTI-LINE STATEMENTS WORK

Note on classes:
    def Vector(x, y)
    ...
    y = Vector(0, 1)
-- first the variables x, y, self are created in the LOCAL SCOPE BEFORE the new function call appends a set() to the prev_line_locals_stack stack




NOT WORKING:
    - with statements maybe not possible
    - make if statements do replacement ie: if x: ==> if 10:
        -- what about if some_dict.get("key"):
        -- and return y[-1]
        -- the python side of things may need to run "exec" to get these values however this may not be safe to do
        test function calls: x.append(Vector(x,y)) # x.append(Vector(1, 2))

Done:
    - make loops work
    test: [] += [a]
    - return x, y, z()
    - object properties changing
        - object.some_value = 10
    - del some_dict[key]
    some_dict[key] = 2

    *  63 │   y = {**{"some": "dict"}, **y}  # y = {'some': 'dict', 'one': 1, 'two': 22}
        y=(('one', 1), ('two', 22)) ──> new value: {'some': 'dict', 'one': 1, 'two': 22}


Todo:
    - dont show value changes for loop variables -- just show inline ie for x in range(3): # x = 1
    - keep indentation -- may need to get this value from frame object
    - make strings have quotes around them ie: instead of b=b --> ... HAVE: b='b' --> ...
    - ASYNC
    - Note: I think if statements wont work great since we wont show the code paths that dont execute and there is a chance we have to interpret those values ourselves
        -- this should be a flag "eval_all_branch_paths"
    - add more substitution logic for function calls and such
    ie: Vector(x,y) shows Vector(0, 1)
    -- same for loops -- maybe not possible though

    - delete inline comments
        - dont have to worry about multi-line strings since those dont have comments
        - how do I tell if a comment is inside a string or not
    - how to tell when a multi-line anything is complete
    - https://github.com/alexmojaki/executing?tab=readme-ov-file#libraries-that-use-this ?
    -- this can get the ast from a frame object


    I think I need to use the dis module to find intermediate fxn return values

    INSTEAD OF:
        y=<generator object complex_fxn.<locals>.<genexpr> at 0x7ffb2d46ae90> ──> new value: <__main__.Vector object at 0x7ffb2d2caa10>
    WE DO:
        y=generator --> new value: Vector(0,1)
    ==> need to remember that signature for an object declaration

convert to file writing:
    - then I can just print things and not have intermediate functions print in order of execution


Not working:

    currently printing the next line number instead of the last one
    how I handle lists

    not sure if I should be using a set anymore ..
    cuz i gotta convert hella other stuff to set each time

    Returns:
        a returned value doesnt print unless its a reassignment
            y = 5
            y = othh()
            works

            y = othh()
            -- prints nothing


Try:
    https://github.com/alexmojaki/executing
    - to get extra execution info for a frame

next:
    - keep checking out competition

Note: dont think my method for tracking variable changes for objects will work for when I add support for searching for certain value changes
- ie: v = Vector(); other_fn(vect); vect.x = 10
- my model is based on variable names so if im searching for changes to v, vect.x wont register
- could get around this by noting when the variable im searching for has initially been declared
- then when u pass it to a fxn, its object ID is marked as being in that fxn

think I need a database
- at least do sqllite
- would just be so much work to parse the csv and would be super slow

what If I did it in json

todo:
    - for each print, this should be an interaction with self.function_stack[-1]
    - for each access of self.printed_line or self.additional_line, this should be an interaction with self.function_stack[-1]

    - find stateful and stateless functions
    - move the stateless ones out of the class


JSON: [
    ..., ..., ..., ...,

DB:
function:
- line_id
- execution_id

CSV:
    curr function:
        - signature
    prev function:
        - signature
    Line:
        - line_num
        - changed_values?
        - code
        - formatted_line
        - additional_line

CSV: execution_id, file_name, line_num, caller_line_number -- use execution_id??, function_signature, caller_function_signature, original_line, formatted_line, additional_line
should I sort the csv in some way at the end ??

Todo:
    create global set of values
    figure out the diff shit and q's i wrote down

    new csv header:
        - the time a function was called in case we call the same fxn with same args each time
            -- ie
            for _ in [1,2]:
                fn()
            has 2 lines in the csv for this loop
            the new header is a number 1, 2 for each time it is called with the same signature

    I think I need to use the dis module to find intermediate fxn return values

convert to file writing:
    - then I can just print things and not have intermediate functions print in order of execution

    -- problem: how to make it clear for when the same function is called twice with diff arguments


Not working:

    not sure if I should be using a set anymore ..
    cuz i gotta convert hella other stuff to set each time

    Returns:
        a returned value doesnt print unless its a reassignment
            y = 5
            y = othh()
            works

            y = othh()
            -- prints nothing
